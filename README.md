# 📝 Algorithm Notebook
This repository includes my annotated LeetCode solution and some interesting graduate-level algorithm analyses. Please check details in the folowing sections!

该项目包含我个人刷LeetCode时所写的代码(含注释)，以及研究生课程内一些有趣的算法分析。请看下文具体介绍！

## 💻 LeetCode Solution
I mainly go with Java and Go. Please go to the folder [leetcode](https://github.com/MaxyZhu75/Algorithm-Summary/tree/main/leetcode) for details.

Since in 2021 I had an internship as a Java Software Develop Engineer in Shanghai, Java is actually preferable to me when coding the solution. Nevertheless, I would say I am able to code with other programming languages too, such as Python, C++, etc. What's interesting is that recently I am learning and super into another coding language Golang. Hence, for each problem, a "Go" version code will be provided too. I will give the weekly update on my Github page. I believe these days coding in my cubicle would be one of the best recollections in my life. 🤓 

因为我在2021年实习时工作中用的是Java，所以平常刷题用Java把算法思路实现也更为熟悉，不过自己也是可以用Python、C++等语言写答案的。而最近我对Go语言非常感兴趣，因此在每次刷题时都会写一个Go版本的答案来进行学习。之后我会在这里每周更新自己写的力扣答案，我相信最后会成为一段很棒的回忆。🤓
## 📚 COMPSCI611 Advanced Algorithm
Please go to the folder [advanced algorithm](https://github.com/MaxyZhu75/Algorithm-Summary/tree/main/advanced%20algorithm) for details.

COMPSCI611 Advanced Algorithm is one of my graduate computer science courses at UMass Amherst. Since problems in this graduat-level course are more challenging, here we focus on the analysis, the main idea behind the algorithms and the correctness proof, rather than the code implementation.

COMPSCI611 Advanced Algorithm是我在UMass Amherst所修的计算机学院研究生课程。该课程内许多问题不需要我们用代码去实现，而是更关注算法背后的思想、给出算法分析以及正确性的数学证明过程。
