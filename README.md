# Algorithm Notebook
This repository includes my annotated LeetCode solution and some interesting graduate-level algorithm analyses. Please check details in the folowing sections! ~

该项目包含我个人刷LeetCode时所写的代码(含注释)，以及研究生课程内一些有趣的算法分析。请看下文具体介绍！~

## LeetCode Solution
I mainly go with Java and Go. Please go to the folder [leetcode](https://github.com/MaxyZhu75/Algorithm-Summary/tree/main/leetcode) for details.

Since in 2021 I had an internship as a Java Software Develop Engineer in Shanghai, Java is actually preferable to me when coding the solution. Nevertheless, I would say I am able to code with other programming languages too, such as Python, C++, etc. What's interesting is that recently I am learning and super into another coding language Golang. Hence, for each problem, a "Go" version code will be provided too. I will give the weekly update on my Github page. I believe these days coding in my cubicle would be one of the best recollections in my life. ^_^

因为我在2021年实习时工作中用的是Java，所以平常刷题用Java把算法思路实现也更为熟悉，不过自己也是可以用Python、C++等语言写答案的。而最近我对Go语言非常感兴趣，因此在每次刷题时都会写一个Go版本的答案来进行学习。之后我会在这里每周更新自己写的力扣答案，我相信最后会成为一段很棒的回忆。^_^
## COMPSCI611 Advanced Algorithm
COMPSCI611 Advanced Algorithm is one of my graduate computer science courses at UMass Amherst. Since problems in this graduat-level course are more challenging, here we focus on the analysis, the main idea behind the algorithms and the correctness proof, rather than the code implementation.

COMPSCI611 Advanced Algorithm是我在UMass Amherst所修的计算机学院研究生课程。该课程内许多问题不需要我们用代码去实现，而是更关注算法背后的思想、给出算法分析以及正确性的数学证明过程。
## Contact
Thank you so much for your interests. Note that this project can not straightforward be your course assignment solution. Do not download and submit my code without any change. Contact me and I am happy to learn algorithms with you and from you guys! ~
